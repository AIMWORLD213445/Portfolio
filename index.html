       <h3>Background</h3>
       <p>I'm originally from Tucson, Arizona and actually have a background in political science and political campaigning. I have undergrad and master's degrees in politics, and was previously a campaign finance intern as well as a canvasser engaged in get out the vote activities. With the growing importance of the digital space in politics (online fundraising, the use of software like NGP-VAN to collect and analyze voter data...etc.), and my own personal intellectual curiosity, this seemed like the perfect time to dive into coding. I'm glad I found Epicodus and am enjoying myself so far. </p>
