    <h2>Background</h2>
     <p>I'm originally from Tucson, Arizona and actually have a background in political science and political campaigning. I have undergrad and master's degrees in politics, and was previously a campaign finance intern as well as a canvasser engaged in get out the vote activities. With the growing importance of the digital space in politics (online fundraising, the use of software like NGP-VAN to collect and analyze voter data...etc.), and a personal interest in technology, this seemed like the perfect time to dive into coding. </p>
    <h3>Current Interests</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="focus">Exploring Portland and the Pacific Northwest.</span> Having recently moved here from Arizona I'm currently enjoying the weather, the large bodies of water, and all of the awesome farmer's markets full of local produce.</li>
      <li><span class="focus">Reading.</span> I'm an avid reader of both fiction(sci-fi, John le Carre espionage genre, literary fiction) and non-fiction(anything on the convergence of politics, technology, economics and how environmental and other outcomes are influenced by the systems around us).</li>
      <li><span class="focus">Visiting Family.</span> I just returned from reuniting with some family up in Seattle that I hadn't had a chance to see in almost a decade. I had a great time and it was refreshing being able to reconnect with some of my awesome cousins.</li>
